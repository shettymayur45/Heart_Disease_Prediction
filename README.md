# Heart_Disease_Prediction
I developed a binary classification model to predict heart illness, achieving an accuracy rate of 89.5%. This project involved extensive data cleansing, including addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features. I used Matplotlib for data visualization to uncover important trends and better understand the data. Multiple models, including XG-Boost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, were implemented and compared, with XG-Boost performing the best. This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis and machine learning, showcasing my ability to handle complex projects and build effective, real-world models.
